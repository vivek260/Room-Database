# Room-Database
This Android Room Database project is a sample application that demonstrates the implementation of a local SQLite 
## Features:

- *CRUD Operations:* Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on the local SQLite database.
- *Entity Definition:* Define database entities using the @Entity annotation to represent tables.
- *DAO (Data Access Object) Interface:* Use the @Dao annotation to define methods for accessing database operations.
- *Database Creation:* Create a database using the @Database annotation and define its entities and version.
- *Asynchronous Database Operations:* Perform database operations asynchronously using Coroutines or RxJava.
- *LiveData Integration:* Use LiveData to observe changes in the database and update the UI accordingly.
- *Repository Pattern:* Implement a repository layer to abstract data access logic from the rest of the application.

## Technologies Used:

- *Android SDK:* Development of the Android application.
- *Kotlin:* Programming language used for writing the application code.
- *Room Persistence Library:* Provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to perform database operations.
- *Coroutines/RxJava:* Used for asynchronous programming to perform database operations off the main thread.
- *LiveData:* Observable data holder class used to notify UI components about changes in the database.
- *MVVM Architecture:* Design pattern used to separate the concerns of the application into Model, View, and ViewModel layers.
